These include individual research projects for ANU students enrolled in COMP3770/4550/8603/8604/8800/SCNC2101. </p> <p>Generally speaking, the research projects to be performed under my supervision lie on the interface of numerical methods for the solution of Partial Differential Equations &#40;mainly finite element methods and scalable multilevel solvers&#41;, High Performance Computing, and Scientific Machine Learning. See also <a href="https://amartinhuertas.github.io/menu3/">here</a> for more details on my research interests and achievements. Thus, they require excellent computational and mathematical problem solving skills &#40;e.g., numerical methods for PDEs and numerical linear algebra&#41;, and preferably some prior experience in numerical computing and/or HPC. You should have excellent written and oral English proficiency, strong programming skills &#40;preferably in Julia, although not a must&#41;, some familiarity with parallel computing architectures &#40;multicore CPUs, distributed-memory computers and/or GPUs&#41;, programming models &#40;such as MPI, OpenMP and/or CUDA&#41; and scientific software version control using Git.</p> <p>As a reference &#40;not actually a requirement&#41; some ANU courses that are helpful to build the skill set required to succeed in research projects under my supervision include &#40;although not restricted to&#41;: High Performance Scientific Computation &#40;COMP3320&#41;, Parallel Systems &#40;COMP4300&#41;, Finite Element Analysis &#40;ENGN6615&#41;, Matrix Computations &#40;MATH3512&#41;, Scientific Computing &#40;MATH3511&#41; and Numerical Optimisation &#40;MATH3514&#41;.</p> <p>As a reference, example topics for research projects are as follows:</p> <ul> <li><p>Matrix-free techniques for the efficient exploitation of multicore CPUs and many-core accelerators in the preconditioned iterative solution of hybridizable PDE discretizations &#40;HDG, HHO, etc.&#41; using multilevel preconditioners.</p> <li><p>Leveraging many-task, DAG-based, asynchronous parallel programming models in Julia in order to extract distant parallelism out of key algorithms in the finite element simulation pipeline &#40;e.g., multilevel solvers&#41; towards increased parallel efficiency and efficient exploitation of heterogeneous hardware architectures &#40;GPUs, co-processors, etc.&#41;</p> <li><p>Leveraging synergies among artificial neural networks and finite element methods for the numerical solution of forward and inverse PDEs. </p> </ul> <p>If you are interested in performing a research project under my supervision, you can directly email me. Carefully write your email, avoiding typos and obvious mistakes. Include in your message background information &#40;e.g., research project academic level, courses taken, academic transcript, programming and mathematical skills&#41; and a concise statement about your motivation to undertake a project under my supervision. Based on your email, I will decide whether we can proceed with an interview. Before emailing, please also read the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>First, familiarise with the ANU entry requirements for the corresponding academic degree. Entry requirements for Honours students are available <a href="https://cecc.anu.edu.au/honours-computing">here</a> while those for PhD/Mphil students <a href="https://cecc.anu.edu.au/study/phd-mphil">here</a>.</p> <li><p>Second, if you are an ANU undergraduate or masters&#39; student interested in Honours, I have various existing project ideas that we may discuss. In any case, project ideas are not limited to the ones I have already in mind. As long as a project aligns with my research directions, I am also happy for you to propose your own project. Therefore, email me to express your interest, including background information &#40;e.g., courses taken, academic transcript, and programming skills&#41; and a concise statement about the research that you would like to undertake.</p> <li><p>Third, for prospective PhD/MPhil students with an excellent academic track record, you might also consider to apply for an ANU research scholarship along with your application to the PhD/MPhil program. See <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/study/apply/anu-postgraduate-research-domestic-and-international-applications">here</a> for more details. </p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Alberto F Martín.
