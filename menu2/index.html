This will help the reader understand my trajectory and the main RLs I have carried out, which are covered in Section <a href="#sec_rt_rl">Past research, trajectory, and main research lines</a>.</p> <p>As a researcher working in the CSE field, I contribute to the development of computational models, algorithms, and software for several application problems. All of these share three common general features &#40;not restricted to, though&#41;:</p> <ol> <li><p>The physical phenomena to be simulated are governed by a &#40;potentially highly nonlinear&#41; PDE, or more generally, by a system of PDEs. These phenomena may span multiple temporal and spatial scales, and involve different physical models.</p> <li><p>The system of PDEs is discretized by means of the FEM. Thus, broadly speaking, the simulation pipeline encompasses three main ingredients: mesh generation and partitioning, space-time FE discretization, and solution of &#40;non&#41;linear system&#40;s&#41; of equations.</p> <li><p>These are application problems with ever increasing modelling accuracy requirements, and thus highly demanding from the computational viewpoint. In particular, simulation pipelines grounded on highly parallel, algorithmically scalable algorithms and HPC software, thus able to efficiently exploit the vast amount of computational resources in current petascale supercomputers, are required in order to achieve the aforementioned modelling requirements.</p> </ol> <p>The increasing levels of complexity both in terms of algorithms and hardware make the development of scientific software able to tackle the aforementioned features, while running efficiently on state-of-the-art numerical algorithms on HPC resources, a scientific challenge in itself. <em>A part of my research work has been devoted towards the achievement of this goal.</em> This is motivated by the fact that research on advanced, newly developed FE discretizations and solution algorithms for the HPC solution of CSE complex problems frequently requires <strong>innovative solutions on the software engineering aspects of a numerical software package as well</strong>, and that these latter also represent an important contribution to other researchers working in the CSE community. </p> <a id=sec_cur_res  class=anchor ></a> <h2 id=current_research ><a href="#current_research" class=header-anchor >Current research </a></h2> <p>Work in progress ...</p> <p>Topics:</p> <ul> <li><p>Hybridizable finite element methods for general polytopal meshes &#40;HDG, HHO, VEM, etc.&#41;.</p> <li><p>Scalable preconditioning for these schemes &#40;h/p geometric multigrid approaches, hybrid multiscale domain decomposition, etc.&#41;. </p> <li><p>Exploiting the synergy among Artificial Neural Networks and the numerical solution of PDEs.</p> <li><p>Scientific Machine Learning approches for large-scale inverse problems.</p> <li><p>Physics-informed Neural Networks with application to prediction of bushfire dynamics.</p> <li><p>Numerical methods for geophysical flows with application to Numerical Weather Prediction.</p> </ul> <a id=sec_rt_rl  class=anchor ></a> <h2 id=past_research_trajectory_and_main_research_lines ><a href="#past_research_trajectory_and_main_research_lines" class=header-anchor >Past research, trajectory, and main research lines </a></h2> <p>This section overviews my research trajectory and main RL pursued. This will be presented in <strong>reverse chronological order</strong>, and split into three differentiated stages, namely: <a href="#sec_senior">senior researcher</a>, <a href="#sec_post_doc">post-doctoral</a>, and <a href="#sec_phd">pre-doctoral stages</a>. We note that that there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence among stage and position at an academic organization.

Early 2016, <strong>I was promoted as senior researcher at the CIMNE</strong>, position which I held until late 2019, concurrently with my position as adjoint professor at UPC. Then, early 2020, <strong>I moved to the School of Mathematics at Monash University &#40;Melbourne, Australia&#41;, where I was appointed as senior research fellow &#40;Level B&#41; for a 3-year period after winning an international competitive call for candidates</strong>. During this period, I have carried out three main RLs which are labeled as RL1-RL3 below. RL3 should be regarded as a cross-cutting, continuous RL , on which the advances of the other RLs are grounded on, and vice-versa.</p> <a id=secrl1  class=anchor ></a> <h4 id=rl1_robust_and_scalable_adaptive_unfitted_finite_element_methods_with_application_to_additive_manufacturing ><a href="#rl1_robust_and_scalable_adaptive_unfitted_finite_element_methods_with_application_to_additive_manufacturing" class=header-anchor >RL1: Robust and scalable adaptive unfitted finite element methods with application to additive manufacturing </a></h4> <h5 id=research_line_statement ><a href="#research_line_statement" class=header-anchor >Research line statement</a></h5> <p>This main research goal of this RL was the development of novel numerical methods for the accurate, computationally efficient and scalable simulation of large-scale transient multiscale PDEs on complex evolving domains, with moving interfaces and/or free boundaries, with application to the simulation of metal AM processes &#40;a.k.a. 3D printing&#41;. The traditional CAD/CAE paradigm, which relies on &#40;semi-automatic, hard-to-parallelize&#41; unstructured mesh generators for spatial discretization, and the &#40;inherently sequential&#41; MOL for time discretization, presents a poor integration among CAD geometrical models and the PDE numerical discretization algorithms, and at the most favorable scenario, is not efficient to tackle problems on non-trivial evolving geometries, <em>if not applicable/feasible at all</em>; see, e.g., Fig.<a href="#fig_am_macro">1</a>. To this end, <strong>my contribution is the development of parallel-friendly advanced discretization methods based on the so-called unfitted &#40;a.k.a. embedded&#41; embedded finite element techniques <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2018">1</a>, <a href="#burman_cutfem_2015">2</a>, <a href="#schillinger2015">3</a>)</span> and their combination with highly scalable parallel linear solvers including multilevel domain decomposition <span class=bibref >(<a href="#toselli2005">4</a>)</span> and AMG <span class=bibref >(<a href="#briggs2000">5</a>)</span></strong>. The final purpose of this research is to speed up the main bottlenecks of large multiscale/multiphysics finite element computations, in particular, the mesh generation, mesh partitioning, and the linear solver phase.

Besides, my project proposal on space-time adaptive unfitted methods has been funded by the Australian National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme &#40;NCMAS&#41; 2021 call.

These projects do not have a strong research component, and are led by the industrial sector. However, they enabled joint collaboration efforts with leading experimental validation partners of AM computer modelling tools. These include SKLSP in Xian, China, MCAM in Melbourne, Australia, and IK4-Lortek in Gipuzkoa, Spain. Both projects have strong technology-transfer potential. They include the application of their advances to the metal AM process of several industrial use cases, such as the patented NUGEAR gearbox by STAM, Italy. </p> <h5 id=publications ><a href="#publications" class=header-anchor >Publications</a></h5> <p>The research work I developed within RL1 has resulted in 8x research manuscripts <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2019a">6</a>, <a href="#neiva2020">7</a>, <a href="#badia_stokes_2018">8</a>, <a href="#badia_aggregated_2017">9</a>, <a href="#neiva2019a">10</a>, <a href="#verdugo2019b">11</a>, <a href="#badia2020">12</a>, <a href="#badia2020robust">13</a>)</span> published in top quality JCR journals &#40;Q1-ranked&#41;.</p> <a id=sec_scalable_amr  class=anchor ></a> <h5 id=scalable_adaptive_mesh_refinement_and_coarsening_with_dynamic_load_balancing_via_forests-of-trees ><a href="#scalable_adaptive_mesh_refinement_and_coarsening_with_dynamic_load_balancing_via_forests-of-trees" class=header-anchor >Scalable Adaptive Mesh Refinement and coarsening with dynamic load balancing via forests-of-trees </a></h5> <p>AMR is a highly appealing technique for the computationally efficient solution of PDEs problems exhibiting highly localized features, such as moving fronts, or internal boundary layers. The basic idea is simple, to adapt the mesh, possibly dynamically, i.e., in the course of the simulation, with a higher mesh resolution wherever it is needed. However, the materialization of this idea on petascale parallel distributed-memory computers is a daunting challenge in itself. Among others, mesh densification in localized areas can cause severe load unbalance. <em>The approach that I have pursued to tackle this challenge grounds on a new generation of petascale-capable algorithms and software for fast AMR using adaptive tree-based meshes endowed with SFCs<span class=bibref >(<a href="#holke2018">14</a>)</span>.</em> SFCs are exploited for efficient data storage and traversal of the adaptive mesh, fast computation of hierarchy and neighborship relations among the mesh cells, and scalable partitioning and dynamic load balancing. In particular, SFCs remarkably offer a linear run-time solution to the problem of &#40;re&#41;partitioning a tree-based mesh into processors. For hexahedral meshes, the state-of-the-art in tree-based <em>amr</em> with SFCs is available at the <code>p4est</code> software <span class=bibref >(<a href="#burstedde_p4est_2011">15</a>, <a href="#isaac2014">16</a>)</span>, which has been proven to scale up to hundreds of thousands of cores. This approach can be generalized to other cell topologies as well <span class=bibref >(<a href="#holke2018">14</a>)</span>.</p> <p>Forest-of-trees meshes provide multi-resolution capability by local adaptation. In the most general case, these meshes are <em>non-conforming</em>, i.e., they contain the so-called <em>hanging VEFs</em>. These occur at the interface of neighboring cells with different refinement levels. Mesh non-conformity introduces additional implementation complexity specially in the case of conforming FE formulations, DOFs sitting on <strong>hanging</strong> VEFs cannot have an arbitrary value, they have to be judiciously constrained. This complexity can be relaxed, at the price of a higher of number of mesh cells, by enforcing the so-called 2:1 balance constraint. Essentially, additional &#40;balance&#41; refinement is introduced in order to bound the ratio among the refinement levels of any two neighbouring cells. The set up and application of hanging DOFs constraints is well-established knowledge <span class=bibref >(<a href="#rheinboldt1980">17</a>, <a href="#shephard1984">18</a>)</span>. <strong>In a parallel distributed-memory environment, these steps are much more involved.</strong> In order to scale FE simulations to large core counts, the standard practice is to constraint the distributed-memory data structures to keep a single layer of extra ghost cells along with the local cells, thus minimizing the impact of these extra cells on memory scalability. Under this constraint, if a set of suitable conditions are not satisfied, then the hanging DOF constraint dependencies may expand beyond the single layer of ghost cells, thus leading to an incorrect parallel FE solver. To make things worse, <strong>the current literature clearly fails to explain when and why the parallel algorithms and data structures required to support generic conforming FE discretizations atop tree-based adaptive meshes are correct.</strong></p> <p><strong>My main contribution has been to address <em>in a rigorous way</em> the development of algorithms and data structures for parallel adaptive FE analysis on tree-based meshes endowed with SFCs</strong>. These are part of a generic FE simulation framework <em>that is designed to be general enough to support a range of cell topologies, recursive refinement rules for the generation of adaptive trees endowed with SFCs, and various types of conforming FEs.</em> Starting with a set of &#40;reasonable&#41; assumptions on the basic building blocks that drive the generation of the forest-of-trees, namely, a recursive refinement rule and a SFC index <span class=bibref >(<a href="#holke2018">14</a>)</span>, <strong>I have inferred results based on mathematical propositions and proofs, yielding the &#40;correctness of the&#41; parallel algorithms in the framework.</strong> A MPI-parallel implementation of these algorithms is available at <code>FEMPAR</code> <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_fempar_2017">30</a>)</span>. <code>FEMPAR</code> uses <code>p4est</code> as its specialized forest-of-octrees meshing engine, although any other engine able to fulfill a set of requirements could be plugged in the algorithms of the framework as well. <em>A strong scaling study of this implementation when applied to Poisson and Maxwell problems reveals remarkable scalability up to 32.2K CPU cores and 482.2M DOFs on the Marenostrum IV supercomputer. Besides, a comparison of <code>FEMPAR</code> performance with that of the state-of-the art <code>deal.II</code> software, reveals at least competitive performance, and at most factor 2-3 improvements on a massively parallel supercomputer.</em> As an illustration, Fig.2 reports remarkably scalability with a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance and scalability of AMR codes, namely the Galerkin trilinear FE discretization of a 3D Poisson problem with a discontinuity in the source term that leads to a solution that is non-smooth along a sinusoidal surface through the domain. This tough problem challenges the performance and scalability of AMR codes, as a very fine mesh resolution is required in order to reduce the error in that area. In a nutshell, the experiments starts from an initial uniform mesh, and the mesh is adapted using a posteriori error estimators across several AMR cycles until a target error criteria is fulfilled. After each cycle, the mesh and related data &#40;e.g., temperature field&#41; is re-distributed/migrated in order to keep the computational load balanced. In Fig.2, we provide the strong scalability on the Gadi supercomputer of the different stages summed across all adaptation levels with 13 and 16 AMR cycles. The curve labelled as &quot;Total sub-assembly&quot; includes the total computational cost involved in the solution of the PDE at hand. The average load per core at the last step ranges, in Fig.<a href="#fig_strong_scaling_fempar_amr">2</a>&#40;a&#41;, from 128.7 KDOFs/core to 4.08K DOFs/core, and, in Fig.<a href="#fig_strong_scaling_fempar_amr">2</a>&#40;b&#41;, from 332.9 MDOFs/core to 20.7K DOFs/core. Beyond that load/core limit, one can barely expect state-of-the-art AMG solvers to be able to reduce the computational time further with increasing number of cores, so that these are excellent scaling results for such a tough problem.</p> <a id=fig_strong_scaling_fempar_amr  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/fempar_am_gadi_scalability.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 2: Strong scaling test results &#40;i.e., global problem fixed, increasing number of cores&#41; for <code>FEMPAR</code> on Gadi.</em></div> <p><strong>This work has been published at the <em>SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing</em> <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2019a">6</a>)</span></strong>.

That is, meshes that conform to the geometrical boundaries of the computational domain &#40;see Fig.<a href="#fig_fitted-vs-unfitted">3b</a>&#41;.

Meshes do not require to be body-fitted, allowing one to simulate problems in complex domains using structured meshes &#40;see Fig.<a href="#fig_fitted-vs-unfitted">3c</a>&#41;. <strong>This salient property is indeed essential for large-scale computations, since the generation of unstructured meshes in parallel and their partition using graph-partitioning techniques scale poorly <span class=bibref >(<a href="#chevalier_pt-scotch_2008">20</a>)</span> and in many cases require human intervention.</strong> Embedded discretisation methods are thus highly appealing, among others, for problems posed on complex geometries, and/or for which tracking evolving interfaces or growing domains in time is impractical using body-fitted meshes; see Fig.<a href="#fig_am_macro">1</a>.</p> <a id=fig_fitted-vs-unfitted  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/figure3_unified.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 3: Body-fitted vs. unfitted meshes. &#40;a&#41; Computational domain. &#40;b&#41; Body-fitted mesh. &#40;c&#41; Unfitted Cartesian mesh.</em></div> <p>In an embedded formulation, the geometry is still provided explicitly in terms of a boundary representation &#40;e.g., a STL mesh&#41; or implicitly via a level-set function.

The most salient one, <strong>still an open problem nowadays</strong>, is the so-called <strong>small cut cell problem</strong>. Some cells of the unfitted mesh can be intersected by a very small part of the domain, which leads, in practice, to arbitrarily large condition numbers in the underlying discrete FE operators. In recent years, different approaches have been considered in order to address the small cut cell problem. Initial approaches consist in adding stabilisation terms to the discrete problem, using some kind of artificial viscosity method to make the problem well-posed; see, e.g., the cutFEM method <span class=bibref >(<a href="#burman_cutfem_2015">2</a>)</span> or the Finite Cell Method <span class=bibref >(<a href="#schillinger2015">3</a>)</span>. </p> <p>In order to avoid, among others, the introduction of artificial viscosity terms into the discrete variational problem &#40;thus sticking into a Galerkin problem&#41;, <strong>I have recently developed in <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_aggregated_2017">9</a>)</span> a novel discretization method for elliptic problems, the so-called AgFEM</strong>; see Fig.<a href="#fig_agfem">4</a>. <strong>In <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_stokes_2018">8</a>)</span>, I have also extended these techniques to indefinite problems in incompressible flow discretisations</strong>. Besides, I have been able to mathematically prove for both the elliptic and indefinite cases that the AgFEM formulation shares the salient properties of body-fitted FE methods such as stability, condition number bounds, optimal convergence, and continuity with respect data. See Figs.<a href="#fig_agfem_poisson">5</a> and <a href="#fig_agfem_stokes">6</a> for selected numerical results. </p> <a id=fig_agfem  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/figure4_unified.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 4: &#40;a&#41; The shape functions associated to DOFs in the exterior of the domain &#40;marked with a red cross in the figure&#41; may have an arbitrarily small support in the interior of the domain.

Krylov methods are well-known to be very sensitive to the conditioning and spectral properties of the linear system coefficient matrix. Most of the works enabling the usage of iterative linear solvers in combination with embedded FE methods consider tailored preconditioners for the matrices affected by the small cut cell problem. The main drawback of this approach is that one relies on highly customized solvers, and therefore, it is not possible to take advantage of well-known and established linear solvers for FE analysis available in renowned scientific computing packages as TRILINOS <span class=bibref >(<a href="#heroux2005">22</a>)</span> or PETSc <span class=bibref >(<a href="#petsc-user-ref">23</a>)</span>. <strong>The AgFEM method solves this issue at the discretization level, and thus opens the door for the efficient exploitation of state-of-the art petascale-capable iterative solvers.</strong></p> <p>Taking this as a motivation, <strong>I have recently developed the message-passing variants of the algorithms involved in all stages of the AgFEM method &#40;e.g., construction of cell aggregates, set up and resolution during FE assembly of ill-posed DOF constraints, etc.&#41;.</strong> Up to the fact that the processors might require to retrieve from remote processors the roots of those cell aggregates which are split among processors, this work has proven the AgFEM method to be a method very amenable to distributed-memory parallelization. In particular, it can be implemented using standard tools in parallel FE libraries, such as ghost cells nearest neighbour exchanges. I have implemented these algorithms in <code>FEMPAR</code> using MPI for inter-processor communications. <strong>Their high appeal at large scales has been demonstrated with a comprehensive weak scaling test up to 16K cores and up to nearly 300M DOFs and a billion cells in the Marenostrum-IV supercomputer</strong> using the Poisson equation on complex 3D domains as model problem. See Fig.<a href="#fig_fig_scalability-agfem">7</a>. The obtained results confirm the expectations: when using AgFEM, the resulting systems of linear algebraic equations can be effectively solved using standard AMG preconditioners. Remarkably, I did not have to customize the default parameters of the preconditioner, demonstrating that users can take what is already available out there &#39;&#39;out of the box&#39;&#39;.

AM has nowadays become sufficiently mature for the 3D printing of metallic objects readily to operate in industrially-relevant applications, including the aerospace, aeronautic, automotive or medical industry, among others. <strong>The main breakthrough of AM is its ability to create cost-effective, short time-to-market objects with properties &#40;i.e., strength, surface quality, material behavior, shape, etc.&#41; almost impossible to produce with traditional technologies as e.g., casting or welding.</strong> However, high-energy sources used to melt metal powders during the printing process induce thermo-mechanical shape distortions and residual stresses, that deteriorate the geometrical quality and the requested material properties. The current industrial practice is based on an expensive, time-consuming, trial-and-error process, which involves the production of hundreds of uncertified copies of the object before reaching the final part. A more sophisticated approach to cope with this limitation is to shift to virtual-based design and certification, using predictive computer modeling tools. <strong>However, state-of-the-art simulation software available at the literature is still far beyond the accuracy and time frame requirements to unlock the full potential of 3D printers in real industrial use.</strong></p> <p><strong>My work addresses, specifically, some of the challenges that arise due to the different length scales involved in the heat transfer analysis of AM processes by PBF methods.</strong> In these methods, a laser is used in order to selectively melt a new PBF layer, which is spread over the building platform with a leveling blade. In this context, typical dimensions of a printed part are on the order of &#91;cm&#93;. However, the relevant physical phenomena are localized around the moving melt pool &#91;Œºm&#93;, following the laser spot. Likewise, the layer size is also on the order of &#91;Œºm&#93;, i.e. the scale of growth of the geometry is much smaller than the scale of the part. The printing of a layer starts with the spread of a layer of powder particles across the building camber, followed by the laser-melting and solidification of the cross section of the part that corresponds to the current layer height. It is clear from here that the material can be either a porous powder or nonporous liquid/solid medium, having rather different thermomechanical properties. A high-fidelity thermal analysis requires &#40;at the very least&#41; that the discretization appropriately captures the interface among the porous and nonporous media. This jeopardizes the use of conventional FE methods, that require a mesh to conform to this interface at all times to provide meaningful results. Even using AMR techniques &#40;to cope with the multiple spatial scales&#41;, this becomes a bottleneck in the simulation, because the mesh size is restricted across the whole layer, even far away from the melt pool. </p> <p>The specific goal is the high-fidelity thermal simulation of the printing process of parts with non-trivial geometries. <strong>Given a set of material and printing process parameters, the outcome with relevant industrial interest is the capability to predict potential printing defects, such as excess or lack of powder fusion.</strong> This sort of insightful information is crucial for application problem experimentalists, as, e.g., those at the Monash Centre for AM, with whom I collaborate. <strong>To this end, I have developed a 3D transient thermal solver that can work on CAD geometries using the <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span></span></span></span>-AgFEM method on background octree-based meshes, reads the scanning sequence of the laser &#40;using the same files as the AM machine&#41;, includes an activation procedure to determine the domain at all times, locally adapts in the melt pool via AMR and exploits distributed-memory parallelism at all stages.</strong> See Fig.<a href="#fig_AM-AggFEM">13</a>. These features, which are cornerstone for increasing modeling accuracy, and applicability to complex, industrially-relevant bodies, are not present in other AM modelling FE tools available at the literature. Indeed, the results obtained with this tool on an multi-core-based HPC cluster equipped with thousands of cores confirm that it is able to simulate AM processes with very thin layers, longer processes, higher deposition volumes, more complex geometries, significantly less time-to-solution etc., compared to the ones reached by a state-of-the-art &#40;non-HPC, non-h-adaptive, body-fitted&#41; software tool. </p> <a id=fig_am-aggfem  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/figure13_unified.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 13: Snapshots of a thermal 3D printing simulation using the <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span></span></span></span>-AgFEM method in order to effectively represent the geometry of the growing piece.</em></div> <a id=sec_rl2  class=anchor ></a> <h4 id=rl2_advanced_numerical_methods_for_the_large-scale_simulation_of_high_temperature_superconductors ><a href="#rl2_advanced_numerical_methods_for_the_large-scale_simulation_of_high_temperature_superconductors" class=header-anchor >RL2: Advanced numerical methods for the large-scale simulation of high temperature superconductors</a></h4> <h5 id=funding__2 ><a href="#funding__2" class=header-anchor >Funding</a></h5> <p>This RL was initiated simultaneously with the FORTISSIMO EU-FP7 experiment project entitled &quot;Multi-physics simulation of HTS devices‚Äù, in a joint collaboration of an HPC software provider &#40;CIMNE&#41;, an application-problem specialist &#40;ICMAB-CSIC&#41;, an HPC service provider &#40;CESGA&#41;, and an end-user, technology-based company in the HTS sector &#40;OXOLUTIA S.L.&#41;.

PIT &#40;Powder In Tube co-extrusion and lamination&#41; and coating technologies have allowed the development of wires and tapes able to substitute copper and conventional conductors in the manufacturing of cables and coils. In the present, the preferred format for these advanced materials is in the shape of flexible metallic tapes. <strong>The benefits of using HTS materials mainly stem from the resistance-free characteristics of HTS wires coupled to its excellent performance in high magnetic fields.</strong> Its range of application goes from very high field coils used for confining magnetically the hot plasma in future nuclear fusion reactors &#40;like ITER or DEMO&#41;, energy storage or high resolution MRI, to motors, generators, cables, transformers or sensors and electronic devices. In all of the above applications, magnetic field, current density, temperature, heat generation, and mechanical stresses related to the high forces developed during cooling down and the working conditions at high magnetic fields should be considered. </p> <p>Computational tools are a powerful technique to simulate the behavior of HTS tapes by solving the system of PDEs that governs the problem. FE methods are commonly used in HTS modeling, because they can handle complicated geometries, while providing a rigorous mathematical framework. <strong>However, HTS modeling is an extremely challenging, computationally-intensive task.</strong> It is a multi-physics &#40;involves electromagnetism, thermodynamics and mechanics&#41;, multi-scale &#40;microns to millimeters&#41;, extremely non-linear problem. An appropriate formulation of the system of PDEs governing the problem, the FE discretization scheme, and non-linear solver thus plays a crucial role in order to obtain meaningful results. The standard practice regarding computational modeling in the HTS community consists on the usage of commercial software &#40;such as e.g., COMSOL&#41;. <strong>These software packages are not typically equipped with HTS-tailored, state-of-the-art numerical methods, and are either sequential or poorly scale beyond a moderate number of cores.</strong> As a consequence, a myriad of simplifications are introduced in the computational model, and computing times span from days up to some weeks, even for very simplified 2D models. In order to by-pass this bottleneck, <strong>the research work that I have carried out pursues the development of advanced, HTS-tailored numerical algorithms, and HPC software tools for the large-scale simulation of HTS tapes and bulk on high-end computing environments.</strong></p> <a id=fig_hts_current_density  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/image21_resized.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 14: Current density profile &#40;color map&#41; computed by the HTS modeling tool for a toy 3D problem at a given fixed time.</em></div> <p>One of the outputs by this RL is a novel HPC software tool, grounded on <code>FEMPAR</code> &#40;see Sec. <a href="#sec_rl3"></a>&#41;, for the non-linear eddy current, AC loss large-scale modelling of HTS tapes and bulks. <strong>The hallmark of this tool, compared to any other available in the literature, is its ability to combine arbitrary-order Edge FEs for the Maxwell Equations with AMR on octree-based meshes &#40;see Sec.<a href="#sec_scalable_amr"></a>&#41; while exploiting message-passing parallelism in all stages of the simulation pipeline <span class=bibref >(<a href="#olm2019">26</a>)</span>, and a novel 2-level BDDC preconditioner that I have developed for the linearized discrete Maxwell Equations with heterogeneous materials able to scale up to dozens of thousands for computational cores <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2019maxwell">25</a>)</span></strong>. The problem to be simulated consists of a superconductor material surrounded by a dielectric &#40;i.e., extremely high resistivity&#41; box, &#39;&#39;large enough&#39;&#39; &#40;compared to region spanned by the superconductor&#41; for neglecting the effects of the superconductor magnetization on the boundary of the dielectric box; see Fig.<a href="#fig_hts_current_density">14</a>. The system of PDEs selected for describing this problem is grounded on the H-formulation of the Maxwell system of equations, properly extended to HTS modelling via a judiciously-selected power law to describe the electric field-current density relation &#40;see <span class=bibref >(<a href="#olm2019">26</a>)</span> and references therein&#41;. This latter constitutive equation, which is required to describe the penetration of the magnetic flux and induced currents on HTS materials, transforms the linear system of Maxwell equations into an extremely non-linear problem. </p> <p>The FE discretization and solver machinery is based on HTS-tailored, state-of-the-art numerical algorithms. First, <strong>the magnetic field is discretized using curl-conforming, N√®d√®lec &#40;a.k.a. edge&#41; FEs of arbitrary order.</strong> The usage of this sort of FE spaces is absolutely essential for the robust and accurate modelling of HTS devices, as they relax continuity-constraints, compared to nodal Lagrangian FEs typically used in the structural mechanics community, by letting the normal component of the discrete magnetic field to be discontinuous across the interface of two media &#40;i.e., superconductor-dielectric box&#41; with highly contrasting properties. On the other hand, <strong>parallel AMR by means of non-conforming, octree-based meshes, is used in order to tackle the multiscale nature of the phenomena, while keeping moderate computational requirements.</strong> For example, in Fig.<a href="#fig_hts_current_density">14</a>, magnetic field and current density have to be captured in high detail within the superconductor through a high resolution mesh, while the ones at the dielectric box hardly vary, and thus a coarse-mesh resolution suffices. Finally, at the &#40;non&#41;linear solver kernel, <strong>I have developed a highly-scalable software implementation of the aforementioned preconditioner &#40;grounded on the advances in Sec.<a href="#sec_rl4"></a>, tailored for the discrete curl-curl operator with heterogeneous materials <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2019maxwell">25</a>)</span>.</strong> In a nutshell, in order to enforce the continuity across subdomains of the method, I have used a partition of the interface objects &#40;edges and faces&#41; into sub-objects determined by the variation of the physical coefficients of the problem. Besides, the addition of perturbation terms to the preconditioner is empirically shown to be effective in order to deal with the case where the two coefficients of the model problem jump simultaneously across the interface. The new method, in contrast to existing approaches for problems in curl-conforming space does not require spectral information whilst providing robustness with regard to coefficient jumps and heterogeneous materials. This numerical algorithm is essential in order to accelerate the convergence of the underlying iterative solver at each Newton-Raphson non-linear step, while keeping bounded the number of iterations for both higher mesh resolution, and number of computational cores.

The BB is one of the key components in a fusion reactor. It consists of a set of micro-channels filled with a liquid metal &#40;Pb-Li&#41; that acts as a neutron shielding, extracts the energy out of the reactor, and produces and extracts Tritium, needed to maintain the plasma. In the frame of the ITER project &#40;See <a href="https://www.iter.org/">https://www.iter.org/</a> for more details.&#41;, the experimental fusion reactor will not have BBs, since the ITER reactor will not be a complete fusion reactor. In any case, it will have the so-called TBMs that will be similar to BBs, and will allow evaluating the feasibility of different BB concepts. There are many TBM designs in progress, but it is unclear whether or not the designs studied nowadays will be useful for the development of BBs. Since the facilities required to carry out experimentation will not be operative in the forthcoming decade, numerical simulation of TBMs is the only way to aid in their design process. The liquid metal flow inside the blanket channels can be modelled through <strong>the thermally-coupled incompressible inductionless MHD system of PDE equations</strong>. This model describes the dynamics of an electrically conducting fluid under an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling, where the magnetic field induced by the currents is negligible with respect to the externally applied one. <strong>The numerical FE solution of these equations is a computationally-demanding task.</strong> Apart from the multi-physics, highly non-linear nature of the system, it involves length and time scales of very different orders of magnitude, leading to truly multi-scale problems. Implicit algorithms are able to obtain meaningful large-scale results without the need to solve for the smallest scales due to stability constraints. However, they require to solve a huge and sparse &#40;non&#41;linear system at every time step, so that massively parallel and scalable algorithms/software as well as the computational power provided by state-of-the-art petascale computers is needed. </p> <h5 id=extreme-scale_preconditioned_iterative_linear_solvers_for_one-physics_problems ><a href="#extreme-scale_preconditioned_iterative_linear_solvers_for_one-physics_problems" class=header-anchor >Extreme-scale preconditioned iterative linear solvers for one-physics problems</a></h5> <p>The block recursive LU preconditioners discussed below, at the preconditioner level, the computation of every physical variable in a multi-physics problem. Thus, even though the starting point is a complex multi-physics problem to be solved, the application of the block LU preconditioner only involves the solution of one-physics problems, usually Poisson or CDR-type problems &#40;diagonal blocks&#41;. Next, these one-physics problem are replaced, e.g., by a highly scalable parallel solver, in order to end up with a truly scalable MHD solver. In this context, a remarkable contribution within RL4 is as follows: <strong>I have been able to demonstrate the high-suitability of Multilevel BDDC preconditioners for the efficient/scalable solution of huge sparse linear systems arising from the FE discretization of linear elliptic PDEs &#40;e.g., Poisson, Elasticity&#41; on current state-of-the-art petascale world-class massively parallel processors.</strong> In order to achieve this goal, <strong>I have proposed a novel bulk-asynchronous, fully-distributed, communicator-aware, inter-level overlapped, and recursive algorithmic adaptation of MultiLevel BDDC preconditioners towards extreme-scale computations</strong> which has been shown to efficiently scale up to the 458K cores of the IBM BG/Q supercomputer installed in JSC, Germany, in the solution of linear elliptic PDE problems with dozens of billions of unknowns; see Fig.<a href="#fig_weak_mlbddc">18</a>. <strong>This work was published in a series of two papers at the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing~ <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_highly_2014">50</a>, <a href="#badia_multilevel_2016">53</a>)</span></strong>. This sort of solvers are not only of paramount importance for large-scale MHD simulations, but are at the core of many large-scale scientific codes grounded on the FE solution of PDE problems. Indeed, extreme-scale solvers for sparse linear algebra is a broad and timely subject of strategic importance, as evidenced by the significant increase in investment during the past few years. <strong>Thanks to these outstanding results, <code>FEMPAR</code> has been qualified for High-Q club status <span class=bibref >(<a href="#brommel_juqueen_2015">59</a>)</span>, a distinction that JSC &#40;Germany&#41; awards to the most scalable EU codes.</strong></p> <a id=fig_weak_mlbddc  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/weak_3D_H_div_h_4_3_bddc_ce_tot.pdf-1_resized.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 18: Weak scalability &#40;computation time in seconds&#41; for a 4-level MLBDDC preconditioner in the solution of a Poisson problem up to 20 billion DOFs on 1.8M MPI tasks at the IBM BG/Q supercomputer.</em></div> <p>Within this line of research <strong>I have also contributed to the rehabilitation of the Balancing Neumann-Neumann preconditioner as an efficient preconditioning strategy for large-scale fluid and solid mechanics simulations <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_enhanced_2013">51</a>)</span>, and to the scalability boost of inexact BDDC preconditioners <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_scalability_2015">54</a>)</span></strong>. Besides, <strong>I have developed a new variant of BDDC for multi-material problems~<span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2018pb">57</a>)</span></strong>&#125;. The coarse space in this preconditioner, referred as PB-BDDC, is based on a Physics-Based aggregation technique, and unlike BDDC solvers based on adaptive selection of constraints, does not involve expensive eigenvalue solvers. The new preconditioner have been shown to be robust and scalable for materials with heterogeneous properties. Besides, in <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2018pb">57</a>)</span>, it is compared against a state-of-the-art, highly efficient MPI implementation of an adaptive-coarse-space BDDC preconditioner implemented in the PETSc software package from ANL. For the largest-scale problem evaluated &#40;more than a half billion DOFs on 8.2K cores&#41;, the new algorithm/software combination is 8x times faster, while consuming significantly less memory resources. Finally, <strong>in <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia2019">58</a>)</span>, I have also developed an enhanced variant of the original BDDC preconditioner that is able to eliminate the condition number matrix dependence on the ratio among the subdomain and mesh resolutions.</strong></p> <h5 id=a_novel_stabilized_fe_formulation_and_block_lu_preconditioning_formulations ><a href="#a_novel_stabilized_fe_formulation_and_block_lu_preconditioning_formulations" class=header-anchor >A novel stabilized FE formulation and block LU preconditioning formulations</a></h5> <p>The Galerkin FE approximation of this problem by means of grad-conforming Lagrangian FE spaces faces several well-known drawbacks. First, convective dominated flows may lead to oscillations because the system loses its elliptic nature. Second, a strong coupling between the two saddle-point subproblems, the hydrodynamic and the magnetic ones, may introduce numerical instabilities when solving the resulting linear systems of equations. Finally, in order to have a well-posed problem, the classical inf-sup conditions between the approximation spaces for the velocity and the pressure must be satisfied. This also applies to the current density and the electric potential as well. There exist several options to circumvent these difficulties, with stabilization methods being one of the most widely used. In order to cope with this problem, <strong>a first remarkable contribution within RL4 comes in the form of a new stabilized, variational multiscale-like FE scheme tailored for this system of PDEs</strong>; see Fig.<a href="#fig_sherc_asgs">19</a> for the convergence analysis of the new method for the so-called Shercliff‚Äôs benchmark, and <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_block_2014">71</a>)</span> for further details. <strong>The most particular feature of these approaches is the current density being treated as an actual unknown of the problem.</strong> This is in contrast to the typical approach based on simplifying the original problem by decoupling the fluid and electromagnetic problems.

The novel approach that was proposed in order to tackle these highly-coupled, multi-physics problems is based on an approximate block recursive LU factorization of the system matrix. An abstract setting presented in <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_block_2014">71</a>)</span> enables the application of this idea to other multi-physics problems like resistive MHD or liquid crystal problems. For the particular problem at hand, I derived two different preconditioners using this abstract setting. The first preconditioner, the so-called fluid-magnetic subproblem factorization &#40;<strong>FMS preconditioner</strong>&#41; is based on an initial factorization of the system matrix into fluid and magnetic subproblems. The second preconditioner, the so-called Field-Lagrange multiplier factorization &#40;<strong>FLM preconditioner</strong>&#41;, segregates at the first level field variables &#40;velocity and current&#41; from Lagrange multiplier-type variables &#40;pressure and electric potential&#41;. The key point for these preconditioners to be efficient relies in obtaining a good approximation of the Schur complement for all 2x2 systems. In order to define the Schur complement approximations, I extended the ideas used for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to the inductionless MHD system. The efficiency and robustness of the FMS and FLM block LU recursive preconditioners was confirmed with respect to both mesh size and Hartmann number by means of a detailed set of numerical tests <span class=bibref >(<a href="#badia_block_2014">71</a>)</span>.</p> <h5 id=large-scale_tbm_simulations ><a href="#large-scale_tbm_simulations" class=header-anchor >Large-scale TBM simulations</a></h5> <p><strong>The combination of all the novel algorithms developed within this RL has enabled large-scale realistic BB simulations up to scales and &#40;high&#41; Hartmann numbers unprecedented in the computational fusion community.</strong> In particular, the HPC software tool developed &#40;grounded on <code>FEMPAR</code>, see Sec.<a href="#sec_rl3"></a>&#41;, was applied to the MHD simulation of a dual-coolant liquid metal blanket designed by the Spanish BB Technology Programme TECNOFUS &#40;details available at <a href="http://fusionwiki.ciemat.es/wiki/TECNO_FUS">http://fusionwiki.ciemat.es/wiki/TECNO_FUS</a>&#41;.

For a large class of application problems, sparse direct solvers have proven to be extremely efÔ¨Åcient. However, the enormous size of the underlying applications arising in 3D PDEs requires fast and efÔ¨Åcient solution techniques. This in turn demands for alternative approaches and, often, approximate factorization techniques, combined with iterative methods based on Krylov subspaces, reÔ¨Çect an attractive alternative for these kind of application problems. With this in mind, <strong>the main RL developed during my predoctoral research was devoted to the design, development, and HPC software implementation of novel task-parallel friendly variants &#40;thus amenable for the efficient exploitation of parallel computers&#41; of multilevel preconditioners constructed from inverse-based ILUs.</strong></p> <h4 id=research_work_description_and_outcomes__2 ><a href="#research_work_description_and_outcomes__2" class=header-anchor >Research work description, and outcomes</a></h4> <a id=fig_ilupack_pivoting  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/ilupack_pivoting.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 22: Left: ILUPACK pivoting strategy. Right: multilevel preconditioner.</em></div> <p>Multilevel preconditioners constructed from inverse-based ILUs lay the foundations for the software package ILUPACK. ILUPACK is the abbreviation for Incomplete LU factorization PACKage. It is a software library, written in Fortran77 and C, for the iterative solution of large sparse linear systems. <strong>The first release of ILUPACK was launched in 2004 by Prof. Bollhoefer, and was restricted to sequential computers. Since then, it has been improved in a number of ways, including its ability to efficiently exploit parallel computers. This latest feature is the main software outcome of my PhD. thesis</strong>. ILUPACK is mainly built on ILUs applied to the system matrix in conjunction with Krylov subspace methods. <strong>The fundamental difference of ILUPACK is the so-called inverse-based approach.</strong> This approach consists on extracting information from the approximate inverse factors during the incomplete factorization itself in order to improve preconditioner robustness. While this idea has been shown to be successful to satisfy this goal, its downside was initially that the norm of the inverse factors could become large such that small entries could hardly be dropped during Gaussian elimination, resulting in an unacceptable level of fill-in in the resulting preconditioner. To overcome this shortcoming, a multilevel strategy is in charge of limiting the growth of the inverse factors. For example, for preconditioning the conjugate gradient &#40;PCG&#41; method, ILUPACK computes an incomplete factorization <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>‚âà</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>D</mi><msup><mi>L</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P\approx LDL^T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class=mrel >‚âà</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.8413em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class=mord ><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span><span class=msupsub ><span class=vlist-t ><span class=vlist-r ><span class=vlist  style="height:0.8413em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class=pstrut  style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, where is <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span></span></span></span> unit lower triangular and entries of small modulus are dropped in the course of the factorization.

Thus, it had to be transformed towards the achievement of this goal. Parallelism in the computation of approximate factorizations can be exposed by means of graph-based symmetric reordering algorithms. Among this class of algorithms, nested dissection orderings enhance parallelism in the approximate factorization of the linear system coefficient matrix <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> by partitioning its associated adjacency graph <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy=false >(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=false >)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G(A)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span><span class=mopen >(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class=mclose >)</span></span></span></span> into a hierarchy of vertex separators and independent subgraphs; see Fig.<a href="#fig_nested_dissection">23</a>.

This type of parallelism can be expressed by a binary task dependency tree, where nodes represent concurrent tasks and edges dependencies among them. State-of-the-art reordering software packages as, e.g., METIS or SCOTCH, provide fast and efficient multilevel variants of nested dissection orderings.</p> <a id=fig_nested_dissection  class=anchor ></a> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/assets/figures/nested_dissection.png" alt="" /> <em>Figure 23: Nested dissection partitioning.</em></div> <p>The dependencies in the task tree are resolved while the computational data and results are generated and passed from the leaves towards the root.

This is the main compromise that it is taken in order to expose concurrent tasks. <strong>The approach proposed leads to an algorithm that exposes a high degree of parallelism, at the price of enforcing a certain order of elimination.</strong> Thus, an important effort of the research work focused on evaluating to what extent the algorithmic variant proposed preserved preconditioning robustness and efficiency. Both set of algorithms were thoroughly compared using metrics such as memory consumption, fill-in ratio in the preconditioner, and number of PCG iterations for a wide range of application problems. <strong>The study revealed that the algorithmic variation introduced has a negligible impact on the numerical properties of the inverse-based preconditioning approach</strong>, in the sense that the convergence rate of the preconditioned iterative method is largely independent on the number of parallel tasks used to decompose the computation.</p> <p>Apart from the novel algorithm design, <strong>I also developed a parallel multi-threaded software implementation of this algorithm written in C and Fortran77 distributed as part of the ILUPACK software package.</strong> The development of a code in charge of the efficient computation of parallel inverse-based ILUs using sparse matrix data structures &#40;i.e., compress storage formats&#41; is of high complexity, and it requires familiarity with a wide range of low-level code implementation techniques &#40;e.g., manipulation of array-based linked-lists in the presence of pivoting&#41;. The target parallel computer architecture of this code is shared-memory and multicore-based parallel computers &#40;equipped with a moderate number of cores, i.e., units/dozens of computational cores&#41;. In a nutshell, some of the features of this computer code are: &#40;1&#41; parallel execution of the task tree orchestrated by a runtime which dynamically maps tasks to threads &#40;processors&#41;, and that can be thus tuned for a particular target platform and a specific application problem. &#40;2&#41; Application of the preconditioner conformal with the logical structure built during its construction to reduce the number of data transferences &#40;cache misses&#41;, and for other major operations in PCG: matrix-vector products, inner products, and vector updates. &#40;3&#41; Use of OpenMP parallel programming to parallelize all stages.</p> <p>Fig.<a href="#fig_par_ilupack_perf"></a> shows the performance and scalability of the code developed when applied to the P1 FE discretization of <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>‚àí</mo><mi mathvariant=normal >‚àá</mi><mo>‚ãÖ</mo><mo stretchy=false >(</mo><mi>A</mi><mi mathvariant=normal >‚àá</mi><mi>u</mi><mo stretchy=false >)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-\nabla \cdot (A \nabla u) = f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class=mord >‚àí</span><span class=mord >‚àá</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class=mbin >‚ãÖ</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class=mopen >(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class=mord >‚àá</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class=mclose >)</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class=mrel >=</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> in a 3-D domain, where then second-order tensor <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=false >(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator=true >,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo separator=true >,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=false >)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(x,y,z)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class=mopen >(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class=mpunct >,</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span><span class=mpunct >,</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.04398em;">z</span><span class=mclose >)</span></span></span></span> is chosen with positive random coefficients.
