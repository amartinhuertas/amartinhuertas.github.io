[Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) is a free and open source {{fe}} library exclusively written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). It is a general-purpose library which, rather than providing pre-bluid solvers for particular equations and methods, it makes available a feature-rich set of tools that allows users to build advanced solvers for their particular needs. With Gridap.jl, one can easily prototype FE methods in a laptop and eventually deploy them in large HPC clusters, with virtually no modifications of the high-level user code, and without departing from Julia code (i.e., no knowledge of C/C++ or fortran required at any point of the workflow).

The library currently supports linear and nonlinear PDE systems for scalar and vector fields, single and multi-field problems, conforming and nonconforming {{fe}} discretizations, on structured and unstructured meshes of simplices and n-cubes. Gridap.jl is extensible and modular. One can implement new {{fe}} spaces, new reference elements, use external mesh generators, linear solvers, post-processing tools, etc. See, e.g., the list of available [Gridap.jl plugins](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl#plugins).

I am an essential contributor to the project since early 2020 (e.g., 3rd in number of commits). I have adquired a deep understanding of its internals, and developed/improved some major components of it, mainly those related to extending it towards distributed memory parallelism and hybridizable finite element discretization schemes. I have also written several tutorials, including a [major one for developers](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t013_poisson_dev_fe/), which goes over its internals, and it is an essential resource to computational math researchers that want to leverage the package for their own research.

### Role: leader

#### FEMPAR 

I am co-founder of FEMPAR (available at [https://github.com/fempar/fempar](https://github.com/fempar/fempar)), an open-source, scientific software package for the numerical modelling of problems governed by {{pde}} on {{hpc}} platforms. It provides a set of state-of-the-art numerical discretizations, including finite element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, XFEM, and spline-based functional spaces. The library was originally designed to efficiently exploit distributed-memory supercomputers and easily handle multiphysics problems. It also provides a set of highly scalable numerical linear algebra solvers based on multilevel domain decomposition for the systems of equations that arise from PDE discretizations. The first public release of `FEMPAR` was almost 300K lines of code written in (mostly) {{oo}} Fortran and it make intensive use of the features defined in the 2003/2008 standards of the language. **`FEMPAR` has been successfully used in 40x JCR Q1-ranked research papers on different topics and application areas**: simulation of turbulent flows and stabilized {{fe}} methods, MHD, monotonic {{fes}}, unfitted {{fes}} and embedded boundary methods, {{amr}}, {{am}} and {{hts}} simulations, and scientific software engineering. It has also been used for the highly efficient implementation of DD solvers  and block preconditioning techniques. Its users/developers span different research groups on national and international-level institutions, including UPC, CIMNE, ICMAB-CSIC, CIEMAT, ICTJA-CSIC, Czech Academy of Sciences (Czech Republic), Sandia National Labs (EEUU), North Carolina State University (USA), Duy Tan University (Vietnam),  Monash University (Australia), and lâ€™Ecole Politechnique (Paris). Besides, it was a crucial tool for the successful execution of several high-quality EU-funded projects, namely, 1x ERC starting grant, 2x ERC PoC projects, 1x EU-FP7 project, and 3x H2020 projects.
