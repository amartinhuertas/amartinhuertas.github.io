## Experience

After completing my PhD studies at Universitat Jaume I, and a short 6-month post-doc at that university (EU-FP7 TEXT project), I moved to Barcelona (Spain) in Mar, 2011, where I did post-doctoral research until Dec, 2015. I worked for CIMNE/UPC funded by two competitive post-doctoral research grants (awarded by UPC and the Catalan gov, resp.) Besides, I participated in two strategic EU projects for CIMNE, the ERC Starting Grant COMFUS, to support basic research in scalable numerical algorithms for the HPC simulation of realistic fusion technology problems, and the EU-FP7 NUMEXAS project, towards the next generation of advanced numerical methods for future exascale computing infrastructures. In Jan, 2016 I was promoted as senior researcher at CIMNE, position which I held until Nov, 2019. Then, early 2020, I moved to Monash University, Australia, where was appointed as senior research fellow for a 3-year period after winning an international call for candidates.

## Participation in Selected Research Projects

I have developed several R&D management roles.  Within the FETHPC-H2020 ExaQute project, I have led the space-time parallelization working package. This allowed me to fund/supervise a 2-year post-doc on numerical methods for large-scale non-linear solid mechanics problems. Besides, in the ERC PoC FEXFEM project, and the EU-FP7 FORTISSIMO projects, acting as delegated PI, I led the corresponding research project teams. Besides, in collaboration with researchers from these institutions, and other EU-level ones, I have participated with major contributions to several high-quality funded EU-level research projects (1x ERC StG, 2x ERC PoC, 2x EU-FP7, 3x EU-H2020, 1x ARC DP), while I have reached to a large extent a position of professional maturity and independence.

## Research Products with Intellectual Property
Author (together with Profs. S. Badia and J. Principe) and essential contributor to `FEMPAR`: Finite Element Multiphysics PARallel scientific computing software.

I am also leading the `GridapHybrid.jl`, `GridapDistributed.jl`, and `GridapGeosciences.jl` packages. I am also a developer of Gridap.jl. These packages provide a fresh FE framework written in Julia for the numerical simulation of models governed by PDEs, from desktop/laptops to supercomputers. These packages exploit the modern features of the Julia language in order to strike a remarkable balance among performance and generality via appropriate mathematically-driven software abstractions.
